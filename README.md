## Description

A house marketplace web app built using React, with a Firebase backend.

### Why Firebase?

This project focuses on React, so this was an opportunity to use cloud-based platform backend that came with its own authentication system and database (Firestore).

### Why React?

I've worked with React on other projects, but I wanted to build a mobile-first web app using React that had a clean interface and focused on simplicity.
